Title: Proposal for a Data Science Resource Repository on GitHub

1. Rationale

A GitHub repository will provide centralized, open access to beginner-level data science resources, curated with relevant metadata for ease of discovery and understanding.
2. User Group

Targeted at students and early-career professionals entering the field of data science.
3. Information Needs

Users need clear, beginner-friendly resources like tutorials, datasets, and scripts with metadata to understand context, authorship, and relevance.
4. Gaps in Provision

Most learning resources are scattered, lack versioning, and do not offer rich metadata to help users evaluate relevance.
5. Evaluation Criteria / Use Cases

Use Case 1: A student finds and downloads a Python notebook for an assignment.
Use Case 2: A user browses by file type or resource category using folder structure.
Use Case 3: A peer contributor evaluates metadata to decide whether to fork the repo.
6. System Specifications

GitHub platform
Organized folders (collections & exhibits)
Each file includes metadata
Publicly accessible with clear documentation
7. Objectives

8. Development Plan
